# Massive Multiplayer mINECRAFT Server for Minecraft 1.16.4

This is a server implementation designed for horizontal scaling of a single survival minecraft world.

Right now the focus is getting it work in a multicore settup on a single machine with full survival capabilities, but 
in the future (not sure exactly when) I plan on supporting server clusters, to allow for much greater degree of 
horizontal scaling.
